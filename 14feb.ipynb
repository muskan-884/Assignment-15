    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "# Multithreading in Python refers to the execution of multiple threads (or parallel execution of multiple parts of a program) simultaneously within a single process. Each thread runs concurrently and can execute different parts of the program concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multithreading is used in Python to achieve parallelism, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of programs that have multiple tasks to perform. It can be used to speed up I/O-bound tasks like reading and writing files, as well as CPU-bound tasks like image processing or numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, the module used to handle threads is called threading. It provides a simple and efficient way to create and manage threads in a program. With the threading module, developers can create new threads, start them, and wait for them to complete.

    "Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.\n",
    "# Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "# Increased performance and responsiveness: Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently. This can result in increased performance and responsiveness, as the program can make use of multiple processors or processor cores to execute tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Efficient use of resources: Multithreading can help make efficient use of system resources, as threads can share data and resources, avoiding the overhead of creating and destroying individual processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simplified programming: Multithreading can simplify programming in some cases, as it allows complex tasks to be broken down into smaller, more manageable subtasks that can be executed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Improved user experience: Multithreading can improve the user experience of an application, as it can keep the UI responsive while performing background tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "# Complexity: Multithreaded programs can be more complex and difficult to write and debug than single-threaded programs. The use of locks, semaphores, and other synchronization mechanisms can introduce additional complexity and increase the likelihood of bugs and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Resource contention: Multithreading can lead to resource contention and synchronization overhead, as threads compete for shared resources such as memory, CPU time, and I/O devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Difficult to debug: Debugging multithreaded programs can be difficult, as the behavior of a program can be affected by the order in which threads execute, making it hard to reproduce and diagnose bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overhead: Multithreading can introduce additional overhead due to the need to manage multiple threads, allocate and deallocate resources, and synchronize access to shared data.\n",
    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "# Deadlocks\n",
    "# A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, and none of them can proceed. This can happen when threads hold locks on resources that other threads need, but none of them are willing to release their locks until they have acquired all the resources they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, suppose there are two threads, T1 and T2, and two resources, R1 and R2. If T1 holds a lock on R1 and is waiting for R2, and T2 holds a lock on R2 and is waiting for R1, a deadlock occurs. Neither thread can proceed, and the program becomes stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and resolve, and can result in a program becoming unresponsive or crashing. To avoid deadlocks, it is important to use synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and monitors correctly and carefully manage resource acquisition and release.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Race Conditions\n",
    "# A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource simultaneously, and the result depends on the order in which the threads execute. This can happen when a shared resource, such as a variable or data structure, is not properly synchronized, and threads can read or write to it concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, suppose there are two threads, T1 and T2, and a shared variable, X. If both threads read the value of X, perform some operation on it, and then write the result back to X, a race condition can occur if they access X concurrently. Depending on the order in which they execute, the final value of X may be different than if they executed sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Race conditions can result in unpredictable behavior and incorrect results, and can be difficult to detect and debug. To avoid race conditions, it is important to properly synchronize access to shared resources using locks, semaphores, or other synchronization mechanisms. Additionally, it is important to ensure that shared data is accessed and modified atomically, using operations that cannot be interrupted.\n",
